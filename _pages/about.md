## About

I am a Master's student in the [BLISS Lab](http://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu/) in the [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) department at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), advised by Prof. Anant Sahai. I also do research in the [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) Lab, advised by Prof. Laurent El Ghaoui. I recently completed my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley with a major in EECS and minor in Theater and Performance Studies. During my undergrad, I worked with Prof. Dawn Song.

## Research Interests

I am primarily interested in investigating theoretical problems within Machine Learning that include, but are not limited to:

- Test-time adversarial attacks (Adversarial Examples) in deep learning
- Train-time adversarial attacks (Data Poisoning) in linear models.
- Generalization performance of overparameterized models for classification.

My research especially leverages insight from Optimization, Statistical Learning Theory, Signal Processing, and I am sure we would find something to talk about if you are interested in any of these fields.
