## About

I am an incoming PhD Student in the [ECE Department](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) of University of Washington, and will be advised by [Prof. Maryam Fazel](https://faculty.washington.edu/mfazel/) and [Prof. Lilian Ratliff](http://faculty.washington.edu/ratliffl/about/).

I recently completed my Masters in the [BLISS Lab](http://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu/) in the [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) department at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I was advised by Prof. Anant Sahai. My master's thesis can be found on the publications tab. I also completed my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley with a major in EECS and minor in Theater and Performance Studies.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie within optimization, statistical learning theory and signal processing. I am interested in investigating fundamental questions in modern machine learning and deep-learning, particularly the generalization and robustness of overparameterized models.
